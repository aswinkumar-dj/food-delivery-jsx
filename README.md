# 🍴 Food Delivery App  

Food Delivery App is a modern web application that allows users to explore restaurants, search for food, filter top-rated items, and add dishes to their cart.  
It integrates with a **location-based Food API (Mayiladuthurai)** to provide real-time restaurant and menu data.  
Built with **React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and Vite**, the app delivers a fast and responsive user experience.
